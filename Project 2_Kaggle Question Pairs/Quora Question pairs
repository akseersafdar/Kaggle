Over 100 million people visit Quora every month, so it's no surprise that many people ask similarly worded questions.
Multiple questions with the same intent can cause seekers to spend more time finding the best answer to their question,
and make writers feel they need to answer multiple versions of the same question. Quora values canonical questions because
they provide a better experience to active seekers and writers, and offer more value to both of these groups in the long term.

Currently, Quora uses a Random Forest model to identify duplicate questions. In this competition, Kagglers are challenged 
to tackle this natural language processing problem by applying advanced techniques to classify whether question pairs are 
duplicates or not. Doing so will make it easier to find high quality answers to questions resulting in an improved experience 
for Quora writers, seekers, and readers.

The goal here is to tell weather the two given questions are related or not. So it is basically a classification problem. 
The output will be either '0' for not related and '1' for related.

Submissions are evaluated on the "log loss" between the predicted values and the ground truth.

For each ID in the test set, you must predict the probability that the questions are duplicates (a number between 0 and 1).
The file should contain a header and have the following format:

test_id,is_duplicate

0,0.5

1,0.4

2,0.9

etc.
